note to author:
make a python code programmed for detecting recent updates made on computer and note&upgrade them
then by a choice of will supported with GUI, let user decide to enable it's automation or not.

note to user:
i know most UNIX/Win systems already has that kind of automation, this code is fully made for learning purposes
feel free to use it or not


WARNING: I tried it after a day. Opened my computer and... it kind of
came out freaky. Can't say it doesn't work, but it's definitely not perfect.
Because the program itself opens at the same time with system, the creepy gui right into your face, not the function itself.

And the thing is, i don't even remember how the damn code works.
Have fun using/fixing it if you have any of those intentions.
